The code takes in the billmonk exported data, parses it and outputs a nested hash. The output is not formatted and is in the raw form. So is the input (does not read the file to be parsed from the command line). 

You would need to edit the line that opens the file and add the name of file to be parsed manually. Then run the script with

ruby BillmonkParser.rb

The output nested hash is of the form @billmonk_matrix[person1][person2], where @billmonk_matrix[person1][person2] would be the amount person1 owes person2
